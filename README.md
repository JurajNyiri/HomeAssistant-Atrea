# HomeAssistant-Atrea

Custom component - climate platform - for Atrea ventilation units for Home Assistant

## Installation using HACS

HACS is a community store for Home Assistant. You can install [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) and then install Atrea from the HACS store.

## Installation:

1. In your Home Assistant instance, create directory `/custom_components/atrea` in your `/config` directory.
2. Copy all files from [/custom_components/atrea](https://github.com/JurajNyiri/HomeAssistant-Atrea/tree/master/custom_components/atrea) of this repository to the newly created directory in your Home Assistant.

## Usage:

### Discrete ventilation/circulation power

For a unit configured to use `Power_2Z` in its web interface, the integration's
fan-mode options can contain named choices such as
`Off,Min-Vent,Norm-Vent,Max-Vent,Norm-Circ/Min-Vent`.
Use only named choices for this configuration; do not mix them with percentages.
The unit's current operating mode can further restrict its usable power choices.
Percentage-based units should keep numeric choices such as `20,50,100`.

This development branch requires the discrete-power API proposed in
https://github.com/JurajNyiri/pyatrea/pull/9. Its manifest temporarily pins the
fork by commit; replace that requirement with an upstream release before merging
this integration change upstream.

Add climate unit via Integrations (search for Atrea) in Home Assistant UI. You can also simply click the button below if you have MyHomeAssistant redirects set up.

Active warnings and alerts are exposed as button entities on the Atrea device.
Each button includes the condition's parameter code, severity, and translated
message. The button becomes unavailable when the condition clears. The filter
replacement warning can be acknowledged from its button. Alert buttons use the
unit's global alarm reset command, matching the original web UI. Other warning
buttons report that their condition cannot be acknowledged because the web UI
does not provide an acknowledgement action for them.

IN1 and IN2 are exposed as voltage sensors and SA1 as a percentage sensor. The
input voltages can be converted to measurements such as CO2 concentration
according to the scaling specified by the connected 0–10 V sensor.

The integration also exposes airflow requirements and measurements, and
heat-pump defrost state when their registers are available. Airflow values are
only meaningful in constant-flow operation; ODA airflow applies to supported
R5 units.

Outdoor, averaged outdoor, supply, extract, exhaust, and indoor air
temperatures are available as native sensors. D1–D4 inputs are exposed as
binary sensors.
